        "Law Context":"1. Regarding the request for non-continuance of alimony: Under the provisions of the Marriage and Family Law, after divorce, alimony is the obligation of parents who do not directly raise children, so regardless of whether the person directly raising the children is economically capable or not, the person who does not directly rear the children shall still have to provide alimony. At the same time, according to the provisions at Point a, Clause 11 of Resolution No. 02\/2000\/NQ-HDTP of December 23,2010 of the Judges' Council of the Supreme People's Court guiding the application of a number of provisions of the 2002 Marriage and Family Law, in cases where the persons directly raising children do not request the persons not directly raising the children to provide support for some reason, the courts should explain to them that the request for support for child raising is the interests of the children so that they know in order If the court considers that the refusal to request financial support is voluntary and that the party concerned has the necessary capacity and conditions to rear the child, it shall not force the other party to provide financial support for the child. Therefore, you have the right, under the above provisions, to request that your father not continue to perform his supporting obligation. However, we argue that you should not, out of anger at your spouse for inaction, not ask him to continue to support your child because it is in your child's interest. Furthermore, there are laws that define the obligation to provide financial support as provided in Clause 2 Article 107 and Article 119 of the 2014 Law on Marriage and Family."
