Step 1: Premises
Provide the premises of the problem in first-order logic sentences, with one premise per line.
Step 2: Conclusion
2. State the conclusion of the problem in first-order logic.
Step 3: Evaluation
3. Guide the evaluation process step by step:
a. Analyze each premise individually and its implications.
b. Apply logical inference to derive conclusions.
c. Consider the relationship between premises and conclusion.
d. Determine if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.
e. If uncertain, explain the reasoning behind the uncertainty.
Step 4: Conclusion Evaluation
4. Finally, state whether the conclusion follows from the premises, doesn't follow, or if it's uncertain.

<<EVALUATE>
Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if a worksheet is not dispensable. From premise 6, we know that a worksheet is either paper or is environment-friendly. If it is paper, then from premise 3, a worksheet is woodware, and from premise 2, a worksheet is dispensable. If it is environment-friendly, we know it is good from premise 5, but we know nothing about whether it is dispensable. Therefore, we don't know if a worksheet is dispensible or not, so the statement is uncertain.
ANSWER: Uncertain
