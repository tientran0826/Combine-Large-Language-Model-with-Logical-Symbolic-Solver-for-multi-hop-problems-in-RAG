# Combine Large Language Model with Logical Symbolic Solver for multi-hop problems in RAG.
*Summary:* The multi-hop challenge pertains to a difficulty encountered by current RAG systems, which aim to improve large language models (LLMs) through a fusion of retrieval and generation techniques. However, the challenge arises when handling multi-hop queries, necessitating the ability to reason across various pieces of supporting evidence. We will consolidate LLM by the logical symbolic solver, and attack the reasoning problem.
